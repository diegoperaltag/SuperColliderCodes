# The world which has become objectified
### for live coding in SuperCollider

> "The spectacle cannot be understood as the abuse of a world of vision, as the product of the techniques of mass dissemination of images. It is, rather, a Weltanschauung which has become actual, materially translated. It is a vision of **the world which has become objectified**." - Guy Debord
 
program notes:

`The world which has become objectified` is a live-coded composition built in SuperCollider, developed as a sonic response to the conditions under which artistic labor, performance, and technological authorship are rendered extractable, reproducible, and consumable. It is not a sonic object in the traditional sense, but a system performed in real time—constructed through procedural logic, layered accumulation, and resistance to narrative teleology. Rather than delivering a polished product, the work foregrounds process, saturation, and code as material.

The decision to compose entirely in a free/libre open-source environment is central. SuperCollider offers a framework that diverges from commercial production platforms and their logics of seamlessness, optimization, and ownership. Here, the act of composition becomes inseparable from the ethics of tool-making. While the piece can be documented, recorded, and revisited, its formal logic resists flattening: what is recorded is not a version, but a trace—one realization among many, framed by the contingencies of execution.

The work unfolds through a recursive layering of sonic procedures—not toward resolution, but toward density and complexity. Its form is not developmental but accretive. Each segment contributes to a slow build-up of processual pressure, challenging conventional expectations of climax, coherence, or interpretability. The listener is not guided through a structure, but immersed within one—invited to inhabit a temporal system where accumulation takes precedence over progression.

`The world which has become objectified` does not seek to express critique through theme or metaphor; it enacts critique through form. It resists being reduced to a reproducible object not by disappearing, but by asserting that presence, authorship, and compositional identity can be reframed. In doing so, it proposes a mode of composing that is less about making something to be consumed, and more about composing as intervention—into code, into sound, and into the systems that seek to contain them.

Dedicated to my SuperCollider professor [Rachel Rome](https://racheldevorah.studio/about/), who made this piece possible.
